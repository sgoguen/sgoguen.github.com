3. As a Team Lead I coordinated with the business stakeholders and the development team to continuously deliver value to the business with Kanban.
4. I balanced technical skills and people skills by being a servant leader and making sure the team had the tools and developed the skills they needed to be successful.
5. My biggest accomplishments were mentoring and training junior developers to be proficient in Angular and TypeScript, testing and cultivating a team that engaged with 
    project managers to develop software with empathy for the customers we were serving whether it be by watching customer interviews or talking to the analytics team to
    understand how customers were using the software.  I'm proud of fostering a culture where team members could be vulnerable and ask for help and where help was readily offered.
    I'm proud they felt safe that they could disagree.  I'm proud they would bring suggestions for improvement to me, because I took the time to seriously discuss and consider 
    their ideas.  I'm proud that most of the time we could come to understandings whether they be contraints of time or resources or other factors, but I'm most proud for 
    when they won me over and we were able to implement their ideas.  I'm proud I was able to leave the team in a better place than when I started.
6. Biggest challenges:
        * We had to rebuild the front-end from scratch in 6 months.
        * Built an purchase order entry system that accelerated the entry of purchase orders for national accounts in 4 months.
        * Built a delivery tracking system 

    
     mentored and trained developers to use the technologies and architectures I designed.  I also worked with business stakeholders to ensure alignment with customer needs.
