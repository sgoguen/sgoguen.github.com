## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how to match up items from two sets, such that every item is paired with a unique partner? Or how to efficiently encode two values into a single one? If so, you might be interested in pairing functions. In this video, we'll explore what pairing functions are, why they are useful, and how to use them as building blocks for more complex operations.

## What is a pairing function?

Definition: A pairing function is a mathematical function that takes two inputs and maps them to a single output, in a way that preserves uniqueness and order. That is, if we have two pairs of inputs that are different, the function will produce two different outputs, and if we swap the order of the inputs, the output will be different too.

Examples: Some examples of pairing functions include the Cantor pairing function, the Szudzik pairing function, and the Rosenberg-Strong pairing function.

## Why do we need pairing functions?

Motivation: Pairing functions are useful in many contexts, such as cryptography, hashing, and data compression. One reason is that they allow us to encode two values into a single one, which can save space or simplify calculations. Another reason is that they can help us establish a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, which is important in many areas of mathematics.

Applications: Some applications of pairing functions include generating unique identifiers, creating data structures such as maps and dictionaries, and encrypting data.

## How to use pairing functions as building blocks?

Composition: Pairing functions can be combined with other functions to create more complex operations, such as composing two pairing functions to obtain a higher-dimensional pairing function, or using a pairing function to construct a hash function.

Examples: Some examples of using pairing functions as building blocks include the Tate pairing in elliptic curve cryptography, the Blum-Blum-Shub pseudorandom number generator, and the SHA-3 hash function.

## How to construct a pairing function?

Methods: There are several ways to construct pairing functions, depending on the properties we want them to satisfy and the operations we want to perform with them. Some common methods include using prime factorization, recursive formulas, and polynomials.

Challenges: Constructing pairing functions that are efficient, secure, and easy to implement can be challenging, and requires careful analysis and testing.

## Efficient pairing functions

Criteria: Efficient pairing functions are those that can be computed quickly and with low memory usage, while still maintaining the desired properties of uniqueness, order preservation, and security.

Examples: Some examples of efficient pairing functions include the Zp-pairing function, the elliptic curve pairing function, and the twisted Edwards pairing function.
