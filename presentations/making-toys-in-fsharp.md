# Making Toys in F#

* This talk is about creating toys to explore ideas and spark discussion
* Not everything is recommended
* I don't advocate all the methods or code in this talk
  * Some ideas intentionally simplified ideas
  * Some may introduce attack vectors
* I'm not an expert.
* Despite all this:  Let's talk about toys and ideas!

# Agenda

* 15 Minutes - Why Make Toys?
* 15 Minutes – Introduction to LINQPad
* 15 Minutes - Simple Printing - Dump
* 15 Minutes - Navigating Objects
* 15 Minutes - LINQPad’s Advanced Features
* 15 Minutes - The Big Picture

# Why Make Toys?

* We want to share ideas and spark discussions
* Toys can communicate ideas that are difficult to explain with words
* Toys are fun!
* Toys allow us to safely experiment
* Toys can make difficult concepts easy to understand
* People tend not to put things labeled “toys” into production
* They simulate and real / professional things
* They remind us not to be too serious!

# Let's Drop The Slides and Talk

* The point of this session is to have a discussion, not just for me to lecture.
* Please interrupt me and ask questions
* I have a planed, but loose agenda - Our conversation is more important
* I want to hear your feedback – 
  * Feel free to write comments in this Google Document while we talks
* I want to continue to have this conversation after the session.

# LINQPad is my Favorite Toy - My Rosebud

* It’s an amazing snippet compiler and script runner with some incredible features
* Best features:
  * It facilitates a fast development cycle because snippets run instantly
  * Feedback is rich and explorable
* I use it to prototype ideas, create toys, and create scripts
* I use it to explain ideas both offline and online (@FSharpCasts)
* It makes coding less painful and fun

# I Want to Share Toys I've Created

* I’ve built some toys that let us do things similar to LINQPad
* They’re unfinished
* I want to show you how you can build them
* I want to encourage you to build toys that you can share with other people without worrying about:
  * If it’s good enough
  * Putting it into production
  * Caring what people think about it
* I want us to focus on programming and collaborating for the fun of it
