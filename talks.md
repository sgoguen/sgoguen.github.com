# Bio

## The GoF Design Patterns in F# 

Since it was first published in 1994, Design Patterns and the Gang of Four (GoF) have influenced hundreds of thousands, if not millions of software developers around the world and giving us a vocabulary to describe common solutions to common problems. While Design Patterns has been hailed by some, it's also been heavily criticized by others.  Some critics describe Design Patterns as a prescription of complex solutions to simple problems, while others point out how their favorite language makes certain patterns irrelevant.  In this presentation, we'll explore how F# changes how we look at some of these patterns from its hybrid functional/object-oriented point of view.

## Hybrid Web Development with C# and F#

F# is thought of as language suited for math intensive applications and overlooked as great tool for building web applications.  We've seen languages like Ruby leverage its dynamic nature to make web development easier. This presentation will talk about how C# developers can add F# to their tool set and leverage F#'s strengths.  We'll see how F# is not only well-suited for modeling your domain, but great at creating reusable components that can be consumed in your MVC applications and be used on the server-side and client side.

## Prototyping with Types and Functions

In this talk, we'll interactively explore ideas by creating models and prototypes we can use to discuss ideas with colleagues and business analysists.  Armed with our toolset, LINQPad, F# and C# will build static, generative and interactive models that let us test our and demo our ideas on the cheap!
