# Available Talks

Below are some of the talks I've given at various venues.

# Bio

Steve works in the building materials industry builds eCommerce, merchandising and delivery tracking systems using a mix of object-oriented and functional components. When he's not busy, he sometimes makes very short F# screencasts on Twitter on @fsharpcasts. You can reach him on Twitter @sgoguen.

## The GoF Design Patterns in F# 

Since it was first published in 1994, Design Patterns and the Gang of Four (GoF) have influenced hundreds of thousands, if not millions of software developers around the world and giving us a vocabulary to describe common solutions to common problems. While Design Patterns has been hailed by some, it's also been heavily criticized by others.  Some critics describe Design Patterns as a prescription of complex solutions to simple problems, while others point out how their favorite language makes certain patterns irrelevant.  In this presentation, we'll explore how F# changes how we look at some of these patterns from its hybrid functional/object-oriented point of view.

## Hybrid Web Development with C# and F#

F# is thought of as language suited for math intensive applications and overlooked as great tool for building web applications.  We've seen languages like Ruby leverage its dynamic nature to make web development easier. This presentation will talk about how C# developers can add F# to their tool set and leverage F#'s strengths.  We'll see how F# is not only well-suited for modeling your domain, but great at creating reusable components that can be consumed in your MVC applications and be used on the server-side and client side.

## Prototyping on the Cheap

Fred Brooks tells us when building a new system to plan to throw one away, because you will, anyhow.  

In this talk, we'll explore different .NET tools & libraries we can use to create models and interactive prototypes that we plan on throwing away.  We'll talk about how we can build simple but readable static models in F# to help us understand the domain model and generate examples.  We'll implement functions in C#/F# that we can show to a business analysist and use fuzzing tools like QuickCheck to look for counter-examples.  Finally, we'll create quick & dirty UIs in LINQPad that let us create interactive models so we can see what happens, and we'll inject random errors to see what happens when things break.
