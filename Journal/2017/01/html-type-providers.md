# Html Type Providers

Html type providers are a fun way to extract information from a semi-structured website.  Let's take this page for example.

Let's say we wanted to provide some simple test data for a test application.  We could create a users table:

## Users

First Name | Last Name | Title
-----------|-----------|-------
Steve      | Goguen    | Software Developer
Larry      | David     | Comedian
