# A Protocol for Real-time Web Interfaces for Command-Line Programs

I love deterministic single-threaded programs that reads a stream of input and writes a stream of output.

I love them because they're easy to understand and test and I don't love tracing through the complexity of 
complicated programs.

They're pretty east to write too.  All you have to do is write a program like so:

```csharp
void Main() {
  var programState = InitializeState();
  
  while(var line = Console.ReadLine()) {
    //  Maybe TransformProgramState prints stuff out???
    var newState = TransformProgramState(line, programState);
    programState = newState;
  }
}
```

What's not to like?

## How to Give a Command-Line Program a Web UI

First, I'm not interested in providing a web UI for any arbitrary command-line program.  
I'm interested in defining a protocol that makes it easy for me to observe command-line programs
and to send data with a web interface.

## Observing a Program

If a program wants to be observable, it should be simply print to the console what it wants the user to observe.
The easiest way to do that is to print out JSON.  By default, we can easily pretty-print the JSON structure and 
refresh the screen everytime something is written to stdout.
